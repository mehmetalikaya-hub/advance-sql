**** First, find daily sums of amount_earned in each city. 
Then, find the average daily amount for all cities for all days. Finally, 
show the id and name of each city plus the number of daily sums that exceeded the average daily amount for each given city.****
-------------------------------------------
WITH daily_sum_city AS (
  SELECT
    c.id,
    c.name,
    ds.day,
    SUM(amount_earned) AS sum_amount
  FROM salesman s
  JOIN daily_sales ds
    ON s.id = ds.salesman_id
  JOIN city c
    ON s.city_id = c.id
  GROUP BY c.id, ds.day, c.name
),
avg_all_cities AS (
  SELECT
    AVG(sum_amount) AS avg_amount
  FROM daily_sum_city
)
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  COUNT(*)
FROM daily_sum_city, avg_all_cities
WHERE sum_amount > avg_amount
GROUP BY id, name;
-------------------------------------------
2) Count the maximal amount_earned on a given day in a given city. 
Then, calculate the average maximal amount across all cities on a given day.
Finally, count the number of days on which that average maximal exceeded $1700.

WITH maximal_earned
AS
(
SELECT 
C.id,
C.name,
DS.day,
MAX(DS.amount_earned) AS maximal_amount
FROM 
salesman S 
JOIN daily_sales DS ON DS.salesman_id = S.id
JOIN city C ON S.city_id = C.id
GROUP BY C.id,C.name,DS.day
),
avg_maximal_earned
AS
(
SELECT 
  day,
  AVG(maximal_amount) AS avg_maximal_amount
  FROM maximal_earned
GROUP BY day
)
SELECT 
COUNT(*)
FROM 
avg_maximal_earned
WHERE avg_maximal_amount >1700
---------------------------------------------------------
3) Find the total number of customers in each region on each day. 
Then, calculate the average number of customers across all regions on each day.
Finally, show the day with the lowest average across all regions (that means, show the day and the avg_region_customers).

WITH total_customers_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
DS.day,
C.region,
SUM(DS.customers) AS total_customers
FROM 
daily_sales DS 
JOIN salesman S ON S.id = DS.salesman_id
JOIN city C ON C.id = S.city_id
GROUP BY DS.day,C.region
),
avg_customers_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
 day,
  AVG(total_customers) AS avg_region_customers
  FROM 
  total_customers_tab
GROUP BY day
)

SELECT 
day,
avg_region_customers
FROM 
avg_customers_tab
WHERE avg_region_customers = (SELECT MIN(avg_region_customers) FROM  avg_customers_tab);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)Compute the city-level average of the total distance travelled by each salesman. 
Then compute the company-level average. Use the example provided in the explanation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH salesman_total_distance
AS
(
SELECT 
DS.salesman_id,
S.city_id,
SUM(distance) AS total_distance_travelled
FROM 
daily_sales DS 
JOIN salesman S ON S.id = DS.salesman_id
JOIN city C ON C.id = S.city_id
GROUP BY DS.salesman_id,S.city_id
),

city_average
AS
(
SELECT
  city_id,
  AVG(total_distance_travelled) AS average_distance_travelled
  FROM salesman_total_distance
  GROUP BY city_id
)
SELECT
AVG(average_distance_travelled)
FROM 
city_average
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) A salesman performs well if his total amount earned is above average amount earned in their city.
We want to show which salesmen perform well.
For each salesman show their first_name, last_name and the third column named label, with either 'Above average' or 'Below average', based on the total amount earned by the salesman.

WITH total_salesman_earnings AS (
  SELECT 
    city_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    salesman_id,
    SUM(amount_earned) AS total_amount
FROM daily_sales d
JOIN salesman s
  ON d.salesman_id = s.id
GROUP BY city_id, salesman_id, first_name, last_name
),
 city_average AS (
  SELECT
    city_id,
    AVG(total_amount) AS city_avg_amount
FROM total_salesman_earnings
GROUP BY city_id
)

SELECT 
  first_name,
  last_name,
  CASE WHEN total_amount > city_avg_amount THEN 'Above average' ELSE 'Below average' END AS label
FROM total_salesman_earnings s
JOIN city_average c
  ON s.city_id = c.city_id
