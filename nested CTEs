**** First, find daily sums of amount_earned in each city. 
Then, find the average daily amount for all cities for all days. Finally, 
show the id and name of each city plus the number of daily sums that exceeded the average daily amount for each given city.****
-------------------------------------------
WITH daily_sum_city AS (
  SELECT
    c.id,
    c.name,
    ds.day,
    SUM(amount_earned) AS sum_amount
  FROM salesman s
  JOIN daily_sales ds
    ON s.id = ds.salesman_id
  JOIN city c
    ON s.city_id = c.id
  GROUP BY c.id, ds.day, c.name
),
avg_all_cities AS (
  SELECT
    AVG(sum_amount) AS avg_amount
  FROM daily_sum_city
)
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  COUNT(*)
FROM daily_sum_city, avg_all_cities
WHERE sum_amount > avg_amount
GROUP BY id, name;
-------------------------------------------
2) Count the maximal amount_earned on a given day in a given city. 
Then, calculate the average maximal amount across all cities on a given day.
Finally, count the number of days on which that average maximal exceeded $1700.

WITH maximal_earned
AS
(
SELECT 
C.id,
C.name,
DS.day,
MAX(DS.amount_earned) AS maximal_amount
FROM 
salesman S 
JOIN daily_sales DS ON DS.salesman_id = S.id
JOIN city C ON S.city_id = C.id
GROUP BY C.id,C.name,DS.day
),
avg_maximal_earned
AS
(
SELECT 
  day,
  AVG(maximal_amount) AS avg_maximal_amount
  FROM maximal_earned
GROUP BY day
)
SELECT 
COUNT(*)
FROM 
avg_maximal_earned
WHERE avg_maximal_amount >1700
---------------------------------------------------------
3) Find the total number of customers in each region on each day. 
Then, calculate the average number of customers across all regions on each day.
Finally, show the day with the lowest average across all regions (that means, show the day and the avg_region_customers).

WITH total_customers_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
DS.day,
C.region,
SUM(DS.customers) AS total_customers
FROM 
daily_sales DS 
JOIN salesman S ON S.id = DS.salesman_id
JOIN city C ON C.id = S.city_id
GROUP BY DS.day,C.region
),
avg_customers_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
 day,
  AVG(total_customers) AS avg_region_customers
  FROM 
  total_customers_tab
GROUP BY day
)

SELECT 
day,
avg_region_customers
FROM 
avg_customers_tab
WHERE avg_region_customers = (SELECT MIN(avg_region_customers) FROM  avg_customers_tab);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)Compute the city-level average of the total distance travelled by each salesman. 
Then compute the company-level average. Use the example provided in the explanation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH salesman_total_distance
AS
(
SELECT 
DS.salesman_id,
S.city_id,
SUM(distance) AS total_distance_travelled
FROM 
daily_sales DS 
JOIN salesman S ON S.id = DS.salesman_id
JOIN city C ON C.id = S.city_id
GROUP BY DS.salesman_id,S.city_id
),

city_average
AS
(
SELECT
  city_id,
  AVG(total_distance_travelled) AS average_distance_travelled
  FROM salesman_total_distance
  GROUP BY city_id
)
SELECT
AVG(average_distance_travelled)
FROM 
city_average
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) A salesman performs well if his total amount earned is above average amount earned in their city.
We want to show which salesmen perform well.
For each salesman show their first_name, last_name and the third column named label, with either 'Above average' or 'Below average', based on the total amount earned by the salesman.

WITH total_earned_tab
AS
(
SELECT
S.first_name,
S.last_name,
C.id,  
SUM(DS.amount_earned) AS total_earned
FROM 
daily_sales DS 
JOIN salesman S ON S.id = DS.salesman_id
JOIN city C ON C.id = S.city_id
GROUP BY S.first_name, S.last_name,C.id
),

avg_earned_city
AS
(
  SELECT 
  id,
  AVG(total_earned) AS avg_earned_per_city
  FROM 
  total_earned_tab
  GROUP BY id
  )
SELECT
TE.first_name,
TE.last_name,
CASE WHEN TE.total_earned > AE.avg_earned_per_city THEN 'Above average' ELSE 'Below average' END AS label
FROM 
total_earned_tab TE 
JOIN avg_earned_city AE ON AE.id = TE.id
-------------------------------------
6) Compare the average number of items sold by salesman from USA (country = 'USA') and other countries in the world.
Name the group column group_name. In your query use values 'USA' and 'Other' to label the groups.

WITH grouping AS
(
SELECT 
id AS city_id,
CASE WHEN country = 'USA' THEN country ELSE 'Other' END AS group_name
FROM 
city 
),
total_items_sold_salesman
AS
(
SELECT
G.city_id,
group_name,
DS.salesman_id,  
SUM(items_sold) AS total_items_sold
FROM
daily_sales DS 
JOIN 
salesman S ON S.id = DS.salesman_id
JOIN grouping G ON G.city_id = S.city_id
GROUP BY G.city_id,G.group_name,DS.salesman_id
)
SELECT
group_name,
AVG(total_items_sold)
FROM 
total_items_sold_salesman
GROUP BY group_name

7) We define 'Good' salesman as those whose total amount earned is above average amount earned in their city.
We want to compare the average number of items sold between the two groups of salesmen: the 'Good' salesmen and 'Bad' salesmen.

WITH total_amout_tab
AS
(
SELECT
DS.salesman_id,
S.city_id,
SUM(DS.amount_earned) AS total_amount_earned
FROM 
daily_sales DS 
JOIN salesman S ON S.id = DS.salesman_id
GROUP BY DS.salesman_id, S.city_id

),
avg_amount_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
  city_id,
  AVG(total_amount_earned) AS avg_amount_earned
  FROM
  total_amout_tab
  GROUP BY city_id
),
grouping_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
TT.salesman_id, 
CASE WHEN TT.total_amount_earned > AT.avg_amount_earned THEN 'Good' ELSE 'Bad' END AS label
FROM 
total_amout_tab TT
JOIN 
avg_amount_tab AT ON AT.city_id = TT.city_id
),
total_items_sold_tab
AS
(
SELECT
GT.salesman_id,
GT.label,
SUM(DS.items_sold) AS total_items
FROM
grouping_tab GT
LEFT JOIN daily_sales DS ON DS.salesman_id = GT.salesman_id
GROUP BY GT.salesman_id, GT.label
)

SELECT
label,
AVG(total_items) AS average
FROM 
total_items_sold_tab
GROUP BY label

8) Find the maximum number of items sold in each city on each day.
Then, calculate the average maximum number of items sold in each city across all days.
Finally, count the number of cities where that average maximal number of items sold is greater than 18.

WITH max_unit_sold_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
C.name,
DS.day,
MAX(DS.items_sold) AS max_num
FROM 
city C
LEFT JOIN salesman S ON S.city_id = C.id
LEFT JOIN daily_sales DS ON S.id= DS.salesman_id 
GROUP BY C.name, DS.day
),

avg_unit_sold_tab
AS
(
SELECT 
name,
AVG(max_num)  AS avg_num 
FROM max_unit_sold_tab  
GROUP BY name
)
SELECT 
COUNT(*) 
FROM avg_unit_sold_tab AT 
WHERE AT.avg_num > 18

9) A city is performing well if their total number of items sold is above average for their region. 
For each city show its name and its label, either 'Above average' or 'Below average', depending on how well the city performs.

WITH total_sold_per_city
AS
(
SELECT 
C.name,
C.region,
SUM(DS.items_sold) AS total_num_of_items
FROM 
city C 
LEFT JOIN salesman S ON S.city_id = C.id 
LEFT JOIN daily_sales DS ON DS.salesman_id = S.id
GROUP BY C.name,C.region
),
avg_sold_per_city
AS
(
SELECT
region,
AVG(total_num_of_items) AS avg_num_of_items
  FROM total_sold_per_city
GROUP BY region  
)

SELECT 
TC.name,
CASE WHEN TC.total_num_of_items > AC.avg_num_of_items THEN 'Above average' ELSE 'Below average' END AS label
FROM 
total_sold_per_city AS TC 
JOIN avg_sold_per_city AC ON AC.region = TC.region
